On Friday afternoon started **Global Game Jam 2016** ([official website](http://globalgamejam.org/)), the most important game development event in the world, now in its eight edition. The premise of the event is simple: **to develop games for 48 hours without interruption**. At the beginning of the long journey participants are organized in small multidisciplinary teams and then they start working on the challenge of developing one or more games.

Each year, the participation has increased significantly. For instance, this year the event has **632 sites** worldwide, and over **25 thousand people**, a remarkable growth when compared with the 518 locations and around 20,000 registered people in 2015 ([official data](http://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj-2015-official-stats)).

Although many of the participants have already met before, one of the main attractions of the event is **to meet other people and develop games with newly formed teams**. In fact, there are notable cases of small game companies that were born as groups that met at a GameJam for the first time.

Another interesting attraction of the event is that **no prior knowledge or preparation is required**. There are many participants who come to the event because they dream of making games and do not know how to begin. The GameJam gives them a unique opportunity to internalize what it means to create video games, in addition to providing a chance to share with experienced people and meet key people in the industry.

In each version of the Global Game Jam, the global event organizers publish a theme, which should be followed by participants from around the world when designing their games. **This year’s theme is “Ritual”** and more than 5000 videogames are expected to be developed around it. After the event is finished, those little games will be posted on the official website and, in some locations, the most outstanding ones will be awarded.

## Global Game Jam in Chile and South America

This year, the event has **three venues in Chile**. The one with the longest tradition is **Valdivia** ([Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/events/1035863749799260/)), where the event has been held for three years in a row. Organized by Universidad Austral and Nemoris Games, the event has more than 70 registrants and it also included several lectures and classes related to videogame development before starting the gamejam session.

**Santiago** ([Website](http://ggjstgo.cl/) and [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/events/1652195321713338/)) has also been a venue in recent years, but organizers have varied each time. This year, the gamejam was organized by the Game Dev UC group, and they managed to gather more than 180 developers. The site promises to become one of the most massive gamejam sessions that has taken place in the country.

Finally, there is also a location in **Viña del Mar** ([Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/vinagamejam)), a city with tradition of such events. Organized by the VG Valpo groups and supported by game companies that reside in the city, this location has also assembled a large group of game development enthusiasts.

**Colombia** has also an important role, with **5 locations** in the largest cities. Meanwhile, the event is growing slowly but firmly every year in the rest of the Southern Cone countries, with **2 sites in Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Uruguay**, and one location in **Ecuador and Paraguay**.
