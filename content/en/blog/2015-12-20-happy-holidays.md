Happy holidays to all of you, especially to those who feel that parenthood and family are one of the main pillars in life.

In this holiday season, it’s a good idea to take a break and use your free time to enjoy some quality time with your beloved ones. Many of our children, like some of us, enjoy playing videogames. It’s a wonderful opportunity to sit down and play some games time with them, sharing a hobby and strengthening your relationship. Don’t miss the opportunity!

I would also like to thank everyone who has supported me on Papa Game Dev, either spending a few minutes to read my articles, sharing them on social networks or participating with your own experiences, comments and suggestions. It has been a nice challenge and I have learned a lot thanks to your contributions.

**Happy Holidays!**
