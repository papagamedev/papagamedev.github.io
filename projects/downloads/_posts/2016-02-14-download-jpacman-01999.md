JPacman is a game inspired on the classic Pac-man, with a couple of interesting gameplay add ons.

It's a personal project I coded in 1998-1999 as a gift to my mom, a super fan of the original Pac-man game.
In late 2015 I found the original code in an old backup disc and I decided to revive the project.

The game name from my name (Juan Pablo) and Pac-man: JP + Pacman = JPacman

Note: This version is only available in Spanish, although you don't need to read too much to play this game ðŸ™‚

## How to Install JPacman

1. The downloded package contains two folders with the game. Choose the one that matcges the Windows version you have installed.
1. Run the JPacman.exe file in the selected folder and enjoy the game!

## How to Play JPacman

- Use the arrow keys to move the main character and eat all the yellow dots to go to the next level.
- Run away from the colored ghosts; if they catch you, you will lose one of your three lives.
- Eat the cookies (kind of donuts, actually) and become stronger for a short time; you can eat the ghosts during that lapse.
- Discover how to get the maximum possible score in the secret X levels!
- Eat the fruits that randomly appear in the center of the screen to get a higher score.
- Be carefule, the yellow dots may surprise you in advanced levels!
- Are you up to the challenge of beating the 32 levels of the game?

Additional notes:

- Use the arror keys and ENTER to navigate through the menus.
